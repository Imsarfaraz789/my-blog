# Full-Stack Blogging Website! 

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Full-Stack Project! ðŸš€

I recently completed a full-stack blogging website using a modern tech stack and I'm thrilled to share what I learned.

## ðŸ”¹ Frontend:
Utilized React.js for dynamic user interfaces and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. And used hooks to mange the state and implemented routing using react-router for seamless navigation.

## ðŸ”¹ Backend: 
Built with Express.js and MongoDB. Created robust RESTful APIs and handled CORS to manage cross-origin requests. Used Postman for API testing and debugging.

## ðŸ”¹ Image Storage: 
Integrated Cloudinary for efficient image storage and management.

## ðŸ”¹ Deployment: 
Deployed the frontend on Vercel and the backend on Render, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.
